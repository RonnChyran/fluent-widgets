# Fluent Widgets

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/sRrJMGm.png)

Subset of Reskinned Win10Widgets for following Fluent Design guidelines.



Also includes a stripped-down version of [groovePlayer](https://c3powen.deviantart.com/art/groovePlayer-2-0-Rainmeter-NowPlaying-skin-658003408) as an Album Art Display.

## What Works?

* Clock
* Hard Disk
* Music (This is a stripped-down version of groovePlayer mini without controls and fading.)
* Performance
* Wifi
* Volume
* Battery

## What Doesn't Work?

Technically these still work but I haven't went through them and fixed the readability of the text after switching to a white background.

* Spotify

* Weather

* Lock

* LayoutSwitcher
